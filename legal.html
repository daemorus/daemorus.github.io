                        <p>Daemorus is a social, casual European gaming community. We started up in Guild Wars 2, with our initial focus on PvE content.</p>
                        <p>The idea behind the community is to expand into a multitude of games. So that regardless of what you feel like playing, you'd have someone to play with.</p>
                        <p>Check us out on Discord to see what other games we play.</p>
